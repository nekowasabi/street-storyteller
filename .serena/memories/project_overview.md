# street-storyteller Overview
- Purpose: Deno-based CLI that scaffolds and manages structured story-writing projects (StoryWriting as Code concept).
- Key docs: `@ARCHITECT.md` (phase plan), `@PLAN.md` (process checklist), `CLAUDE.md` (repo rules), `README.md` (general usage).
- Layers: shared abstractions, application services, infrastructure adapters, CLI entry in `src/cli.ts`.
- Current focus: Phase 1 logging and configuration foundations per @PLAN.md/@ARCHITECT.md.
